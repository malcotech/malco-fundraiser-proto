# Fundraiser Prototype App

My sample fundraiser app using React. One of my goals is to get re-familiarized with React and try to make the app look, feel, and work like an authentic fundraiser app. This is for my own personal use, to develop and grow my software development experience. Thank you for visiting my project and supporting my journey :+1:
